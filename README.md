# Pokedex
<p>Pokedex was an attempt to create a small web application using just 
VanillaJS (just a &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; at index.html and no css at 
all)! I discovered that this kind of stuff is <bold>hard</bold>. The project is 
almost complete, but it keeps getting more and more complicated. And yes, I 
thought about organizing the code, reducing duplicates and making it more 
maintainable, but that's exactly what frameworks do. So, I'd need to try and 
create a new one. But it just does not make sense, unless I want to do it just 
for the sake of it or for some kind of innovation. And indeed I started doing something to organize the code. 
That is AcardJS. You can take a look

Finally, I concluded that there's a difference between writing a program in Python and in C, and in apps like this one, it's better to use Python.
